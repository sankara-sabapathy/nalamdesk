# Initial Setup (Vault Creation) 🔐

When you launch NalamDesk for the first time, you will be greeted by the **Setup Wizard**. This process initializes your local secure database (the "Vault") where all patient data is stored encrypted.

## Step 1: Welcome Screen
You will see a "Welcome to NalamDesk" screen.
- Click **"Get Started"** to begin.

## Step 2: Clinic Information
Enter the details for your practice. These details will appear on:
- Prescription headers.
- Bills and Invoices.
- Patient communications.

**Required Fields:**
- **Clinic Name**: (e.g., "City Health Clinic")
- **Doctor Name**: (e.g., "Dr. Smith")
- **Specialization**: (e.g., "General Physician")

## Step 3: Admin Account Creation
Create the primary Administrator account. This account has full access to all settings.

**Fields:**
- **Username**: Choose a unique username (e.g., `admin`).
- **Password**: Must be at least 4 characters long.
- **Confirm Password**: Re-enter to verify.

> **Important**: If you lose this password, you cannot recover the encrypted data easily without the Recovery Key.

## Step 4: Recovery Key 🔑
The system will generate a **Recovery Key**.
- **SAVE THIS KEY**: Write it down or save it in a password manager.
- This key is the *only* way to reset your password if you forget it.

## Step 5: Completion
Once verified, you will be redirected to the **Login Screen**.
- Enter your new credentials to access the Dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### "Application Already Setup"
If you see this message, a database already exists on this machine.
- **Solution**: logging in with existing credentials. Use the "Forgot Password" flow if needed.
