# Welcome to NalamDesk

We are excited to introduce NalamDesk, a secure, offline-first clinic management system.

## Why NalamDesk?

Medical data privacy is paramount. Unlike cloud-based systems where you lose control of your data, NalamDesk stores everything locally on your device, encrypted with AES-256.

Stay tuned for more updates on our features and roadmap!
